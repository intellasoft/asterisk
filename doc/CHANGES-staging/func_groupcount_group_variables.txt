Adding Group Variables and additional Group functions

DumpGroups
-------------------
* New application.  This will dump all channel group membership and associated
  variables

Groups and Group Variables
------------------
 * Group variables can be set on a group once the group is created
   When a group is destroyed, all variables on that group are also destroyed

   A group variable is somewhat like a global variable on a per-group basis.

   GroupSet - Adds functionality to the manager to be able to set a GROUP()
              on a channel.
   GroupsShowChannels - Show each channel and it's associated groups
                        (a channel will be repeated for each group@category
                         it's a member of)
   GroupsShowVariables - Show variables in each group@category, one event per
                         group, all variables are contained in each
                         group@category event
   GroupVarSet - Set a group variable (the group must already exist)
   GroupVarGet - Get a group variable

 * New Manager events:
   ------------------
   GroupCreate - Event is fired any time a group is made,
                 ie: Set(GROUP=x) or Set(GROUP()=x@y).
                 This event is only sent on when a channel is added to a group
                 that did not exist previously.
   GroupChannelAdd - Event is fired any time a channel is added to a group
   GroupChannelRemove - Event is fired any time a channel is removed from a
                        group
   GroupDestroy - Event is fired when there are no longer any channels assigned
                  to the group
   GroupVarSet - Event is fired when any group variable is changed

 * New CLI Command
   ---------------
   group show variables

 * New Application
   ---------------
   DumpGroups() - Show groups and group assigments (similar to DumpChan)
